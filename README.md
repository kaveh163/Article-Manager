# Article Manager

In this project I built an article manager CRUD app where the users of the website can simply create, update, delete and view articles. This app uses validation for creating the articles which all the fields should be entered and the passwords should match. For the validation process Express Validator which is a set of Express.js  middleware was used. 

Below are the snapshots of the project.
